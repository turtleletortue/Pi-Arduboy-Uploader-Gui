# Pi-Arduboy-Uploader-Gui
A simple python program that uses Eried's Arduboy repository and MrBlinky's python tools to make flashing programs from the raspberry pi a lot easier

IMPORTANT!!!!!!:
This is based on Mr.Blinky's python uploader tools
(https://github.com/MrBlinky/Arduboy-Python-Utilities)
And Eried's Game Collection (http://arduboy.ried.cl/ aka https://github.com/eried/ArduboyCollection)
This wouldn't exist without these two, so make sure to thank their developers
All credit goes to MrBlinky and Eried

The ideal use case for this is a raspberry pi with curl, tkinter(python), and git installed
However, this should work on any linux os with those packages

This tool offers a gui to upload games from Eried's repo via MrBlinkys python uploader tool

All tools and repositories necessary are automatically downloaded

All you need to do is run "python3 gui.py" in a folder with the repo files in it
